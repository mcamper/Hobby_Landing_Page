        <p class="myStory">My journey into web development started with the basics: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript—the essential building blocks of any website. Exploring these technologies has helped me understand how websites are built and how they function behind the scenes. Web development has become a creative outlet for me, allowing me to bring ideas to life through design and functionality. It’s also a rewarding challenge that pushes me to solve problems and think outside the box. Along the way, I've discovered that consistent practice is the key to honing my skills and growing as a developer.</p>
